# multiple-disease-prediction-streamlit-app

The Multiple Disease Prediction Streamlit App is a web-based application designed to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on user-input health parameters. Built using Python, Streamlit, and Machine Learning, this app provides an interactive and easy-to-use interface for making disease predictions. It leverages trained machine learning models to analyze health data and assess the probability of conditions such as Heart Disease, Diabetes, and Parkinsonâ€™s Disease.

The application follows a structured pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, and deployment, ensuring accurate and efficient predictions. The datasets used for training the models have been sourced from publicly available medical repositories such as Kaggle and the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The models implemented include Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree Classifier, each optimized for specific diseases to enhance prediction accuracy.

To run this project, users need to install the required dependencies using the provided file and launch the application using the streamlit run app.py command. The app features a user-friendly interface, allowing users to input relevant health data and receive instant predictions. Future improvements aim to expand disease coverage, improve model accuracy through feature engineering, and deploy the application on cloud platforms for better accessibility.

This project serves as a valuable tool for preliminary health assessment and aims to bridge the gap between machine learning and healthcare, making disease prediction more accessible to a wider audience.
